I have /player; which lists a bunch of players.

The idea of this app is to track player time in the form of sessions.


Player
    name Text
    nick Text
    email Text Maybe
    phone Text Maybe
    note Textarea Maybe
    minutes Int Maybe
    deriving

Table
    name Text
    game Text 
    pointsHour Int
    seats Int Maybe
    description Text Maybe
    deriving

GamingSession
    start UTCTime
    end UTCTime Maybe
    player PlayerId
    table TableId
    seat Int Maybe
  

/session GamingSessionR POST GET

GET Will show current open sessions
POST Will start a new session and and expects { PlayerId, TableId , Maybe Int } to be posted. UTCTime for start will come from Data.Time.Clock


It seems I want to do input only. 


I don't now what to put for the fieldtype for the necessary PlayerId and TableId

do
    gamingSession <- runInputGet $ GamingSession
                     <$> ireq textField "player"
                     <*> ireq textField "tableId"
    defaultLayout [whamlet|<p>#{show gamingSession}|]


I also dont know if I can add my own values 'inline' to create a Gaming session (ie something like)

do
    gamingSession <- runInputGet $ GamingSession
                     do { start <- getCurrentTime }
                     Nothing
                     <$> ireq textField "player"
                     <*> ireq textField "tableId"
                     <*> iopt intField "seatNumber"
    defaultLayout [whamlet|<p>#{show gamingSession}|]


or do i need to create a helper type, something like

data Helper = Helper
  player :: PlayerId
  table :: TableId
  seat :: Int Maybe

do
  gamingSessionHelper <- runInputGet $ Helper
          ..
       do {start <- getCurrentTime }
       let gamingSession = GamingSession start Nothing (gamingSessionHelper player) (gamingSessionHelper table) (gamingSessionHelper seat)
       in ...
